# Collections
# Lists, Tuples, Dictionaries & Ranges
# Store multple values in a single variable
# Items in a collection are considered elements 
# Elements can also be collections 


# Lists
# Stores 0 or more items at specific indexes, items accessed based on index 
# Cannot access items at indexes that don't exist
# Can contain multiple types of variables in Python, makes it flexible but slow 
# Mutable 


# Tuples
# Similar to lists
# Immutable 


# Dictionaries
# Stores a key-value pair at each index 
# Each element is a tuple of a key-value pair
# Accessed value based on key, not index 
# Can retrieve list of just keys or just values 
# Mutable 


# Ranges 
# Represents lists of consecutive whole numbers but lacks the functionality of lists 
# Needs specific start and end values 
# Step values can be specified, for example 2, to skip every second element in the range  
# Can be counted backwards in a reversed() function
